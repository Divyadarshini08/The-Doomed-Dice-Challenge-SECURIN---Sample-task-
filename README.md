# The-Doomed-Dice-Challenge-SECURIN---Sample-task-
This is one of the sample tasks given by securin, for their interview process preparation

**Problem Statement: The Doomed Dice Challenge**

The below problems must be solved & implemented in Python/Java/Ruby/C++/Go.

You are given two six-sided dice, Die A and Die B, each with faces numbered from 1 to 6.
You can only roll both the dice together & your turn is guided by the obtained sum.
Example: Die A = 6, Die B = 3. Sum = 6 + 3 = 9

You may represent Dice as an Array or Array-like structure.
Die A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], where the indices represent the 6 faces of the die & the value on each face.

**Part-A (15â€“20 Minutes):**
1. How many total combinations are possible? Show the math along with the code!
2. Calculate and display the distribution of all possible combinations that can be obtained when rolling both Die A and Die B together. Show the math along with the code!
   Hint: A 6 x 6 Matrix.
3. Calculate the probability of all possible sums occurring among the number of combinations from (2).
   Example: P(Sum = 2) = 1/X as there is only one combination possible to obtain Sum = 2. Die A = Die B = 1

**Part - B (30 mins):**
ðŸ§© Problem Statement (Simplified):
You're given two standard dice:

Die_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Die_B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Due to Loki's mischief:

Die_A canâ€™t have more than 4 spots on any face. Duplicates allowed.
Die_B can have any number of spots, even more than 6.
But the combined dice must retain the same probability distribution of sums as standard dice.
